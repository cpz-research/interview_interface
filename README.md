### Setup
- Environment: for now, just used `ai_interviews`, but also installed streamlit
- Try on local machine with: `streamlit run .\code\interview.py`, on MAC: `streamlit run ./code/interview.py` (CTR + C to stop it)

- Or just commit/push on main branch and check `https://interview-labor-supply.streamlit.app/?sid=3&iid=PART_TIME` a few seconds later
